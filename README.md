Code for [Learn C++ by Example](http://mng.bz/RZAa)

The original working title was Bootstrap C++, hence this repo's name, then we considered C++ Bookcamp, and settled on Learn C+ by Example. 

The book is aimed at beginners who know C++ basics, coders coming back to the language, or current C++ developers missing out on everything the language has to offer.
